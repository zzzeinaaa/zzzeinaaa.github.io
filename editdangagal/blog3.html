            <h3>Mental Health in the Middle East</h3></br></br>
            <p>Mental illness is not rare throughout the United States. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), approximately 44 million adults in the U.S. reported a diagnosed mental illness in 2014. [1] This number does not include people under the age of 18 and adults with mental illnesses that have not been diagnosed. Despite this large number of mental illnesses reported, organizations in the U.S. have been funding and researching harder than ever to answer significant scientific questions about mental illnesses.[2] As a nation, it is impressive how far we have come in understanding mental illness, creating campaigns to eliminate negative misperceptions of it, and teaching others to be sensitive towards those with an illness.</p>
            <p>While, overall, positive progress is being made in the U.S., what about other regions around the world, like the Middle East? The Middle East and North Africa, a region abbreviated as MENA, might not exactly be making the same progress. Scholars on the topic have stated that “mental health is not a strong priority in the MENA region and services are not widespread despite efforts there”.[3]As a first-generation, Middle Eastern immigrant living in the U.S., I can attest to the fact that there is an apparent difference in how mental illness is perceived in the U.S. versus in the MENA.  Growing up, mental health was not often discussed with family or friends as much as physiological diseases. My parents did not seem to care for or understood the prevalence of mental illness around the world until my older brother became the first in my family to study psychology and clinical counseling. This all made me realize that perhaps there are nations outside of the United States that perceive mental health as a frivolous issue, one that remains undiscussed in polite company.</p></br>

<p>When analyzing statistics, scholars have commented on the fact that that there is a comparable amount of mental illness in MENA to other nations. In fact, there are some rates of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression in the MENA region higher than any other nation. [4] So, the MENA region should not be excused from having mental health services and efforts to recognize those that are mentally ill.</p>

<p>Thus, why is there such a paucity and underutilization of mental health resources in the MENA? In a 2013 study titled “Factors affecting attitude towards seeking professional help for mental illness: a UK Arab perspective”, researcher Aseel Hamid sheds light on the compelling responses of Arabs in MENA on mental illnesses and  seeking professional help. In the study he details that arabs:</p>

<p>displayed negative attitudes to professional help-seeking and to those with mental illnesses
“had a stronger endorsement of supernatural causes of mental illnesses stemming from some Islamic beliefs, such as dangerous, unprovoked spirits and the evil eye” which opposed  “the western physiological causes of mental illness which attributes mental illness to chemical imbalances in the brain and genetics”[5]
These negative perceptions carried by Arabs in the study led Hamid to conclude that there is a stigma of shame surrounding mental illness in MENA, making it less likely to seek professional help.</p>

<p>Hamid’s study provides an invaluable perspective on the perceptions of mental illness outside of the United States and the western view. Additional research would be beneficial in scrutinizing further the perception Arab’s have on mental illness, other perceptions of mental illness around the world, and whether these perceptions are rooted mostly in religious, cultural ties, or both. In the meantime, it is important to continue to raise awareness on mental health resources, so that we can create environments where a mental illness is not stigmatized and that help is sought when needed.</p>
